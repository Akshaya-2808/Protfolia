<h2 >Project</h2>
<p style="font-size:18px; "><b>Classification of Glaucoma from Fundus Images Using CNN.</b></p>
<p style="font-size:18px;">Developed a deep learning model utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the early detection of glaucoma, a severe ocular condition that can lead to irreversible vision loss if untreated. This model was meticulously trained and validated across diverse datasets, enhancing its generalizability and ensuring robust performance in real-world clinical applications. The approach significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of glaucoma detection compared to traditional diagnostic methods, facilitating early diagnosis and potentially preventing vision loss. Technologies used include Machine Learning and Python.</p><br>
